### •  Software — Your DVC

To quantify deformation from continuous experimental biomedical imaging of specimens, we developed a digital volume correlation software, Your DVC. This open-source software can measure the deformation of a series of biomedical images (more than two) of a specimen, with control over interpolation order, regularization type and coefficient, and the initial field guess, enabling accurate voxel-level displacement and strain analysis.

### •  Experimental deformation tracking via imaging

Using our software on continuous imaging data, we successfully track the experimental deformation of specimens, from the cellular to the tissue level. The measured deformation can be analyzed directly or incorporated into corresponding computational models as boundary conditions or field inputs, bridging experimental observations with predictive simulations.
