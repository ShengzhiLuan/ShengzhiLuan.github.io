Hi, I am a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/), working in the [Skeletal Mechanobiology and Biomechanics Laboratory](https://morganresearchlab.org/) with Professor [Elise F. Morgan](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/elise-morgan-ph-d/). Previously, I completed my Ph.D. in the Department of Civil and Systems Engineering at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), advised by Professor [Stavros Gaitanaros](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/stavros-gaitanaros/). Before that, I earned my M.S. in Civil Engineering from [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/) and my B.S. in Civil Engineering from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/).

Research Interests
======
My research focuses on the **mechanics of architected materials** bridging engineered metamaterials, human bone, and biomedical scaffolds to **advance musculoskeletal health** through **experimental**, **computational**, and **artificial intelligence methods**. At the core of my research lies: <u>leveraging mechanical principles of metamaterials to assess bone fracture risk, while simultaneously translating mechanical designs of metamaterials as scaffolds to support bone tissue regeneration</u>. Particularly, my research interests are:
- Nonlinear mechanics and failure mechanisms of metamaterials
- Machine learning-aided design of mechanically multifunctional metamaterials
- Multiscale biomechanics of bone
- Artificial intelligence-assisted clinical assessment of skeletal fragility
- Mechanics-driven design of bone regenerative scaffolds
